# What are these notes?
Hi, I'm Barclay. 
This is my work in progress public facing Digital Note Taking System.

This system was is inspired by the [[Zettalkasten Note-taking|Zettalkasten]] and its contemporaries such as [[Evergreen Notes]]. 

There are many reasons on why I am embarking on spending output on a project like this. 

Here are a few reasons for building out a second brain? 
- [[How having a second brain makes the writing process 73% more efficient]]
- [[Information Overload]] 
- [[Slow Burn vs Heavy Lifts, Why working on multiple projects can be beneficial]]
 
The principles for the design of the second brain:
- Concept-Oriented
- Atomicity 
- Densely Linked 
- Idea-Development over Summarising existing ideas
