# What are these notes?
This is my work in progress public facing Digital [[Zettalkasten Note-taking|Zettalkasten]] System.

Why a second brain? 
- [[How not having a second brain makes the writing process 73% more inefficient]]
- [[Information Overload]] 
- [[Slow Burn vs Heavy Lifts, Why working on multiple projects can be beneficial]]

These notes are my collection of [[Evergreen Notes|Evergreen Notes]]. 

Principles for the design of the second brain:
- Be selective of what makes it into the second brain.
- Every note needs a link to an existing page. 
- Every note needs to be atomised to contain a single idea. 
- Each idea should contain as much as is needed on the topic.
